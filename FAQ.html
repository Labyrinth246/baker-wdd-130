                <dd>
                    This may happen to many customers who use our website. We are still relatively new and are working hard to include as many types of different phone cases as we can. As of right now there are only about 8 different phones that we support cases for, but rest assured, soon we will have more and more coming out for you to choose from. Right now if we do not have a phone case for your specific phone, contact us and let us know the phones you want us to include!

                <dd>
                    Depending on where you are buying your case from it can take anywhere from 2-3 business days to 1-2 weeks. Our main office where we make the phone cases that you design is located in Portland, Oregon. If you live in the United States it will take only a couple days to recieve your case unless there is a problem in shipping which we notify you about. However, if we are shipping overseas, it could take a couple weeks to get to you, depending on how far away you are from our headquaters.

                <dd>
                    We do in fact have warranties on our phone cases that you desing. Depending on the style of phone case you choose, we give you certain warranty lengths. If it is the protective style case the warrenty is 2 years and if your case breaks or fails to protect your phone, simply ship your case back to us and we will send you a new one for free! If the case style is the creative style, the warranty length is 1 year and if it breaks or the design fades, simply ship it back to us and we will send you a new one for free!

                <dd>
                    Depending on the case style that you purchase, they have differing levels of protection. Both case styles have built in shock protection when you drop your phone. However, the protection style case has much more protective layering and also has port protection. The creative style case does not have as many layers but still protects your phone while having more customizibility. Whatever you choose, the case will do its job and protect your phone well while looking great!

                <dd>
                    We have two different styles of cases right now that you can choose from! We are always working on getting you more and more choices so that you can design it exactly how you want! Those two case designs we have are the Protective and Creative styles. The Protective style has some good customizibility but is more geared towards protecting your phone, especially if you are the outdoors type or work outdoors. The Creative style has protection but more customizibility than the Protective case design.
