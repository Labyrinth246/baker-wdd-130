                I have chosen to use the following fonts for my site:

                    Merriweather: Used for headlines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    PT Sans: Used for the primary font.

            <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of this website is to build revenue and essentially be the main front of the business. The website is to allow consumers to create and design their own phone cases and then their designs are sent from that website to the warehouse to create their case and send it to them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The website allows us to receive their information on what they want and where they are so that we can ship the product to them. It also allows us to receive funds for the case making process. The purpose of the website is to be the middleman from the company to the consumer.

            <h2>Audience Statement</h2>
            <p>
                The audience for this website will be anyone who has a phone and is looking for a phone case that meets their protective and stylized needs. The main audience range is most likely going to be from ages 12 â€“ 40. The buyer is most likely gong to be somewhat financially stable because this is an accessory to a phone and is not essential. This means that the target audience will be in more wealthy cities and towns. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The people we hope to find are those who have had struggles with phone cases in the past. Either that they brake or that the design they saw was not exactly what they wanted. This website allows those people in that range to design and create their own case. The goal is to create options for hundreds of different phones makes and brands. My intention is for this website to be accessed on a laptop or pc.
            </p>

            <h2>Misson Statement</h2>
            <p>
                Our goal is to help those who wish to have a better phone case that they can make themselves, and to meet the costumers needs in what they desire stylistically, protectively or both. This allows them to feel secure about how their phone case looks as well as how protected their phone will be. 
            </p>
            <p>
                At first, my goal is to simply make presets of different phone case options for their specific phone and then to enable them to change colors. Eventually I would like to develop as simplistic a software as I can, that allows consumers to totally design their phone case from scratch. The website is to simplistically create a way for consumers to choose their own designs for their case and make it their own.

                <h3>Scenario</h3>
                <p>
                    Jacob recently had to buy a new phone because his phone broke and the screen shattered by falling out of his hand. Jacob had even bought a phone case for protection, even though he did not like what it looked like, and his phone still broke. Jacob is an active person and likes to run, rock climb and do many other activities.<br><br> He is looking for a phone case for his new phone that would protect it in the case that it might fall, or he might drop it and look and feel like how he wanted it to. Jacob has looked online before but there does not seem to be many options for a nice-looking, convenient phone case that is also adept at protecting his phone, until he found our website.
