       </p>
       <p id="ap">
           Project Case started as just an idea and a couple design tools. We were frustrated not getting what we asked for when we bought a case, having our phone case fail to protect a phone, or not look like how we wanted it to. Thats why we created this website for everyone to use. No longer will you be wondering if the phone case you bought will look how you want it or protect your phone. We have you covered! Currently we have only one shipping center and headquaters in Portland, Oregon, but we are trying to exand as much as we can to help everyone feel secure about their cases.<br> These are some of our employees who have helped us from go from zero to hero!
